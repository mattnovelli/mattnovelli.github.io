<h3>October 30, 2020 - Matthew Novelli</h3>

<hr>
    <em>
<p>Willard Sullivan takes every opportunity he gets to ride his bike.
Even in the dead of Illinois winter, you can find him biking to class. This
summer, Sullivan plans to take his rides to a new level by biking from New York
to California—and he’s not alone.</p>

<p>Sullivan is a member of “Illini 4000,” a registered student
organization at the University of Illinois that holds annual cross-country bike
rides. The rides – held since 2007 – aim to raise money for cancer-focused
charities and promote cancer awareness. Each rider has a goal of raising at
least $4,000 before the ride–so far this year’s 21 riders have collectively raised
over $55,000 according to <a href="https://www.illini4000.org/"> their
website</a>. The funds are then gathered and donated to various
cancer-oriented charities and research groups including “Camp Kesem,” which
provides “free week-long summer camp experience and year-round peer support” to
families affected by cancer. In 2018, the team donated over $118,000 to
charities according to <a

annual financial report</span></a><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:
107%;font-family:"Georgia",serif'>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
"Georgia",serif'>Sullivan’s affinity for mountain biking and road biking runs
in the family. “I’ve always been interested in biking across America because my
dad did it when he was younger. That’s actually how I first found the club.”
The charity and social aspects of the club are bonuses for Sullivan, as he
says, “honestly I’m most excited about meeting new people and creating a
stronger bond with my team.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
"Georgia",serif'>The three-month ride consists of 70 stops strewn across New York
and San Francisco. The stops – called “stayovers” – are community centers,
churches, YMCAs, and anyone willing to house the riders for the night. </span><a
href="https://www.illini4000.org/mail-drops"><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:107%;font-family:"Georgia",serif'>You can even send the riders mail
along the route.</span></a><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;
font-family:"Georgia",serif'> Along the way, the group carries out interviews
with Americans affected with cancer and compiles them into the “Portraits Project,”
a branch of Illini 4000. Stayover hosts are instructed to assemble local cancer
survivors, patients and family members to tell stories for the project. Then, interviews–or
“portraits”–are compiled on </span><a name="_Hlk54866060"></a><a
href="https://www.portraitsproject.org/Portraits"><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:107%;font-family:"Georgia",serif'>the Portraits Project website</span></a><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Georgia",serif'>. However,
Sullivan tells me a lot of these interviews happen by chance. “A lot of times
it’s just random people off the street, like if the team stops at a gas station
sometimes people walk up and ask what Illini 4000 is. Sometimes they’ve
personally had cancer or someone they’ve known has had cancer.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
"Georgia",serif'>According to the American Cancer Society, cancer is usually
found in older people with “80% of all cancers in the United Stated diagnosed
in people 55 years of age or older.” Since cancer is classified as a group of
diseases, “more than 1.8 million new cancer cases are expected to be diagnosed
in 2020.” </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
"Georgia",serif'>The ride was originally planned for Summer 2020 but was
postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. A shorter ride was scheduled later in
the summer but was also cancelled. Sullivan says the team is still determined
to complete the ride this summer by hosting meetings and training sessions
online. “Everything is virtual… if you feel comfortable joining an in-person
workout session we have those up to five people.” There’s even a plan to host
virtual interviews with cancer survivors for the Portraits Project. The team’s
virtual workout sessions consist of 2-hour trainings on the weekend accompanied
by 1-hour midweek trainings. The regiment includes running and sit-ups – more
than enough to prepare riders to bike across the country.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
"Georgia",serif'>For 2021, the group is recycling the unused route from 2020. Each
rider was tasked with finding at least 2 out of the 70 stayovers on the route, a
difficult task since they’re essentially asking for accommodation free of
charge. Sullivan tells me, “I was assigned two stayovers somewhere in
Washington last year… what I did was I opened Google Maps and started scrolling
around the town, seeing what kinds of establishments we could stay in.” Many
places were receptive to the group, and some riders had personal connections to
the stayovers. Others weren’t so kind, as Sullivan described calling a golf
course that replied, “well what do you think we’re supposed to do?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
"Georgia",serif'>Doubt lingers in the air as to whether the ride will happen
this summer. “We’re taking a huge risk here… I would be pretty frustrated if it
doesn’t happen this year, but very understanding.” It’s clear from speaking
with Sullivan that he’s passionate about his team and their mission. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
"Georgia",serif'>“Illini 4000 is extremely special in the way it promotes
cancer research but also promotes team bonding… I don’t know of any other
organization that does a trip of this magnitude – and is successful.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
"Georgia",serif'>The team hits the road May 22<sup>nd</sup>, 2021, pandemic permitting.
