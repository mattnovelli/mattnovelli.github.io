<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
"Georgia",serif'>Seasonal jobs are one thing, what about seasonal stores?
Spirit Halloween is one of the only “seasonal retailers” in America. Owned by
Spencer’s Gifts, Spirit Halloween (or just “Spirit”) has been taking over
vacant retail storefronts since 1984 to sell Halloween-themed costumes and
decorations.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
"Georgia",serif'>I sat down with my friend Dillon Benson – Spirit’s newest
employee – via Zoom to learn more about Spirit. <i>This interview has been
edited for length and clarity.</i></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;
font-family:"Georgia",serif'>What do you do at Spirit?</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
"Georgia",serif'>My official title is “Spirit Halloween Sales Associate,” which
is a generic term for underling. I do whatever the management needs me to do –
I work the register and “walk the floor,” which is my favorite thing to do.
Most of the time I help people “fix their costumes” by upselling them on a
bunch of stuff.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
"Georgia",serif'>The animatronics are really popular. A lot of people will come
in asking if we have a certain animatronic to which I’ll say no. And no, we
don’t have a “back room” that we can check.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;
font-family:"Georgia",serif'>How did you hear about this job?</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
"Georgia",serif'>My manager from the gym I used to work at is now a Spirit
Halloween regional manager. When they started building the stores this year, she
told me they needed “strong boys” like me. So, I helped build the store and now
I work here.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;
font-family:"Georgia",serif'>What was the process of taking over a store like?</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
"Georgia",serif'>It’s a lot of fixing problems as they come up. The store I
work at used to be a gym, so it has a nice big bathroom with locker rooms. We
had to block off the men’s bathroom – to convert the women’s bathroom to unisex
– so they had us take down the signs. That’s where I got this sign from [Dillon
held up a men’s’ bathroom sign].</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;
font-family:"Georgia",serif'>Tell me more about “building” the store.</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
"Georgia",serif'>It’s really simple I guess. The walls we put up are really
heavy, big and finnicky, and I hate it. We have to wire the speakers around the
back of the portable walls which sucks. We also have to put wooden stakes
inbetween the walls and cover them in wallpaper which takes forever – it’s not
hard or complicated, just tedious. We have guides on how to display the
merchandise on the shelves but more often than not we don’t have enough to fill
the shelves.</span></p>


<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;
font-family:"Georgia",serif'>…what condition was the store in when you first
walked in?</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
"Georgia",serif'>My first day I had to manually open the automatic doors at the
front of the store since the power was off. There was no one there, I thought
to myself “what the heck is going on?” and then I walked to the back where I
found some people unloading a truck.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;
font-family:"Georgia",serif'>Have you heard anything about Spirit Halloween’s </span></b><a

style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Georgia",serif'>online fanbase</span></b></a><b><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Georgia",serif'>?</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
"Georgia",serif'>What? What are you talking about?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
"Georgia",serif'>Okay, there are definitely people like that in the store. There
was a little girl, about six years old, she walked through the entire store and
called out every animatronic by name and said, “Oh my god they have Bubba!” I
was like “What? How do you know this?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;
font-family:"Georgia",serif'>What’s your favorite item?</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
"Georgia",serif'>The soul eater one. It’s a grim reaper holding a girl with fog
coming out of her mouth. It’s called the “</span><a

of Souls</span></a><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
"Georgia",serif'>.” But it breaks a lot – my manager was showing me how you
have to siphon the fog out of it with your mouth when it breaks down.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;
font-family:"Georgia",serif'>Do you have a Halloween costume planned?</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
"Georgia",serif'>I always dress up as what my mom wants me to go as. Last year
I was Steve Harrington from “Stranger Things,” this year she wants me to be Billy
Butcher from “The Boys.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;
font-family:"Georgia",serif'>Honest, has anything in the store scared you?</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
"Georgia",serif'>No. I see everything get built. Before it even gets scary,
I’ve pulled back the curtains and now they’re just goofy to me. There is one kind
of scary one that I don’t like. It’s an old lady in a dress that makes old lady
zombie noises for 2 minutes at a time. I hate it, it’s annoying, and it makes
me uncomfortable.</span></p>
