<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:106%;font-family:
"Georgia",serif'>As colleges and universities around the United States near the
end of the Fall semester, students are reflecting on the changes to their
academic lives brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic. Many schools have
flip-flopped between in-person and online instruction, and some students caught
in the crossfire can’t help but feel left behind. Other students feel the
transition to online learning has benefitted them, especially those who feel
they’re technologically inclined. One thing is clear – the American college
experience will never be the same.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:106%;font-family:
"Georgia",serif'>In 2020, an unprecedented amount of schools switched to online
instruction. However, the Pew Research Center’s </span><a

American Trends Panel</span></a><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:106%;
font-family:"Georgia",serif'> found that about 68% of U.S. adults would
disagree when asked if “a course taken only online provides an equal
educational value compared with a course taken in person in a classroom.” This
is especially felt by remote students. Jason Zou is a student studying computer
engineering at the University of Illinois. However, Zou isn’t living on campus
for the Fall semester. Instead, he does all his schoolwork remotely from his
home in the Philadelphia suburbs. Zou said he agreed with data, but it was less
about the lecture itself and more about the experience. “I think on the
surface, things like lectures are fairly similar in terms of effect… everything
else is kind of made a little more difficult. Things like casually asking
someone sitting next to you about something – you can’t really do that.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><a
href="https://www.pewresearch.org/pathways-2020/covidchg/education/us_adults/"><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:106%;font-family:"Georgia",serif'>Another
poll conducted by Pew Research</span></a><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:106%;font-family:"Georgia",serif'> shows U.S. adults with better
educations are more likely to say their lives have “changed in a major way”
because of the pandemic. “I think it’s definitely affected my motivation… I’m a
lot lazier now because I don’t really have to get out of bed, I can just skip
class and watch [lectures] later,” says Vance Ursiny, an undergraduate student
at the University of Illinois studying Chemical Engineering. He added on,
suggesting there is a silver lining: “I also think that studying has been a lot
easier in the way that most professors upload their lecture slides and videos
of their lectures.” This response was somewhat surprising, as Pew Research
notes that “College graduates are among the most likely to say that online
classes do not measure up to in-person ones.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:106%;font-family:
"Georgia",serif'>The toll on students isn’t just academic – many students are
finding online classes negatively affecting their motivation and emotional
wellbeing. Ursiny says, “I definitely feel a lot less energy lately, but I can
say for a fact a lot of my friends have been affected negatively and have been
dealing with some deflated emotions as a result.” Zou, on the other hand, says
his emotional wellbeing “has overall been kind of worse, I don’t really have
any casual day-to-day interactions… your sense of time really changes when all
you do is wake up and go 3 feet to your right.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:106%;font-family:
"Georgia",serif'>The COVID-19 pandemic is currently worsening in the United States,
and as students prepare for Fall break, colleges will once again be faced with
the decision between in-person and online instruction.</span></p>
