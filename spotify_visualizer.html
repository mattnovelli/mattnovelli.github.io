                <p>
                    The other day I found a nifty visualizer/default Winamp plug-in called <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://www.geisswerks.com/milkdrop/">milkdrop</a>, which you have probably already heard of if
                    you're on this page. I've been trying to figure out how to get milkdrop to work with Spotify, and after a few days I have found a few solutions, which I will present here.

                <h3>Method 1: ProjectM</h3>
                <p>
                    This is the simplest solution, but in my opinion the worst. ProjectM is an open source version of Milkdrop, but lacks the advanced menus of Milkdrop 2, it's not windowed, and it listens to the "Stereo Mix" of your PC,
                    meaning playing other audio is impossible. Still, it's very simple to set up, and is even available in the Windows Store.

                <h3>Method 2: Spotiamb + OG Winamp</h3>
                <p>
                    This solution is a bit harder, but completely worth it. It works by extracting Milkdrop 2 from the last version of Winamp then installing that into Spotiamb, a piece of joke software made by a Spotify engineer around 2015 -- basically a tweaked version of Winamp that could stream Spotify. Although the Spotiamb website was taken down you can
                    <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160109220758/http://spotiamb.com/">view the archived site here</a>, and download the latest version of Spotiamb below. You also need the
                    latest version of Winamp (pre-resurrection), which can be found on the Milkdrop creator's homepage (below).<br>

                    </center>
                    <br>
                    After installing both softwares, you have to copy some files over from Winamp to Spotiamb.

                <h3>Method X: VLC</h3>
                <p>
                    VLC, the internet's favorite media player, has projectM support. Go to your VLC preferences (Ctrl + P), click "All" preferences in the bottom left, find <i>visualizations</i> and choose your .milk directory. Running Milkdrop on VLC is incredibly buggy and there's no Spotify support.
